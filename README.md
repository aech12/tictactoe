Tic tac toe made with React.
History is stored an object with arrays. Each array contains the board at that current step. Computer uses the Minimax algo to play. No caching.

Todo
Style

Functionality
- Refactor code, it's messy and bloated
- Add option to play first or second (!)
- Add caching to Minimax (!)
- Check test 'counter winning moves' with board 'testCase'. Sometimes it fails.
- Implement ref maybe. Let PregameOptions manage playerName state

Bugs (!)
- Style - Board breaks with small screen (300px)
- When clicking in history and playing against PC it doesnt work
