Tictactoe made with React.
History of each move can be accessed (the whole board is saved as an array).
Single-player available. The computer makes moves through a minmax algorithm.

Style

Functionality
- Refactor code, it's messy and bloated
- Add option to play first or second (!)
- Add caching to Minimax (!)
- Implement ref maybe? Let PregameOptions manage playerName state

Bugs (!)
- Board breaks with smallest screens (300px)(CSS)
- When game is over, computer still makes a move, as shown in the ul
- Test 'counter winning moves' with board 'testCase' sometimes fails
